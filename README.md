# Molecular Targets for Treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease

Here, we perform data analysis to discover the disease state of Parkinson‚Äôs disease, identifying the interactions between ùõº-synuclein proteins using the mechanism of networking by performing RNA sequencing and dataming in blood-based gene expression data. We compute the Gibbs Free Energy associated with the genes involved and use its properties corresponding to the gene expression level to see the potential of eliminating the link between protein pairs to theoretically reducing the overall chain reactions within human bodies. Target proteins of interest and their significances are determined according to their uniqueness to Parkinson‚Äôs disease. We also calculate the correlation between Gibb energy and disease progressions as a higher concentration of misfolding protein could lead to a higher risk of developing severe symptoms by moving to the next stage. Our analysis states that CALM1, UBC, FBXO7, HSPA5, TP53 may have the potential to reveal the molecular targets of treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs disease
